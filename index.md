Connected Documents
===================

- Documents are applications are documents
- Connected objects interact with documents

Documents
=========

CouchDB: documents = metadata + attachments

Applications are Documents
==========================

(CouchApps)
-----------

Documents are Applications
==========================

Consider a CouchDB document that consists of

- a web page, which interprets
- metadata (JSON) and
- content-related attachments

It is a self-running document.
-----------------------------

Documents are Applications are Documents
========================================

(CouchDB is assumed)

Example: e-book
===============

- index.html = application = e-book reader
- content (book): as attachment(s)
- JSON metadata: store user's progress, book metadata, ..

Offline-first
=============

Since the application is embedded with the content,

Connected Documents are natively offline-first.

Connected objects interact with documents
=========================================

Physical Objects
================

- Interact with their physical environment (duh!)
- Interact with documents

Physical objects
================

- Feed the document/application data about their environment
- Document asks them to interact with their environment
- Gather data and react to it on their own
- Modify the document when they are connected with it

Connected Documents
===================

- Documents are applications are documents
- Connected objects interact with documents
