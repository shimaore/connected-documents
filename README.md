Connected Documents
===================

Connected Documents consists of four major components:
- a web platform and services, independent of a particular application domain (be it toys, learning tools, etc.) used to create, deliver, and if needed generate income from, connected documents;
- the web platform works together with a user-device application, be it mobile or PC, to deliver connected documents to that device;
- a hardware electronic platform, common to all application domains but customizable in hardware (at production time) and in software (in realtime), which is controlled by the user-device application;
- and finally, a custom application built for the specific application domain, consisting of documents (which might be called lessons, exercises, games, etc. depending on the domain) which are specific to the application domain and interact with one or more hardware components via the application installed on the user-device.
